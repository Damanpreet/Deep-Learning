To run the model, please use the command - 
python main.py

This file needs the dataset - cifar_2class_py2.p. One can re-use the CIFAR10 dataset that can be found online and retain only two classes in the dataset to have CIFAR2 dataset.

My model gives 82% accuracy on the training dataset and 78% accuracy on the testing dataset.

On tuning the hyperparamters even further the accuracy should increase.
